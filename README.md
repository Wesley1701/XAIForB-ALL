# Capstone Project Group 3

## Dev Container:
### Requirements:
[Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Quick Start:
- Clone repo :)
```
git clone https://github.com/Wesley1701/XAIForB-ALL.git
cd XAIForB-All
```
- Open Project in VS Code
- Reopen in Dev Container
  - Press `F1` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
  - Type `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
  - Wait while VS Code builds the container (first time only - Can take a few minutes)
  - You're now inside the dev container, extensions are installed inside the container so you probably miss some of your personal extensions
